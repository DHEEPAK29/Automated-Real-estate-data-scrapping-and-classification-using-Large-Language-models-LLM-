# Automated-Real-estate-data-scrapping-and-classification-using-Large-Language-models-LLM-
This project involved the dev of automated system for scraping and classifying real estate data using Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary goal was to save time by streamlining the data collection, enhance the accuracy of data classification for real estate listings. Ensured the business requirements were effectively integrated into the appl. Tools/Libraries: Langchain, MODEL: llama2, Hugging face API.
